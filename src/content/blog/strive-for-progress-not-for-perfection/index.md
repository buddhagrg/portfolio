There is no shortcut, there is no magic. The perfect world exists only in the movies. The fear that something may not become perfect or the fear of something being _either all or nothing_  will freeze us from taking new steps. The fear of being judged and getting failures should not be the main reason to stop by. We make mistakes, then we learn from them. As time goes, self-appreciation and improvement will help us to fuel positivity. It is crucial to know that moving forward and celebrating small wins have good impacts in life. Small wins make big changes. The biggest hack of life is to slow down and prioritizing the essentials instead of focusing on Hundreds of things at once.
