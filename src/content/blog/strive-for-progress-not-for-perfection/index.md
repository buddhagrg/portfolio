There are not shortcuts, there are no magics. Perfect world exist only in the movies. The fear that something may not become perfect or the fear of something being _either all or nothing_  will freeze us from taking new steps. The fear of being judged and getting failures should not be the main reason to not make moves. We make mistakes and we learn from it. As the time goes, self-appreciation and improvement will help us fueling the positivity. It is important to know that moving forward and celebrating small wins have good impacts. Small wins make big changes. The biggest hack of life is to slow down and prioritizing on the essentials instead of focusing on the Hundreds of things at once.
